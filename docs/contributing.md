# How to Contribute 

We are excited that you want to contribute to our source of truth! Following these guidelines helps to ensure that all changes are consistent, reviewed, and high-quality. 

## The Golden Rule All changes must be made through a **Pull Request (PR)**. Direct pushes to the `main` branch are blocked. 

## Your First Contribution 
1. **Create a Branch:** * From the `main` branch, create a new branch with a descriptive name. Use the format `your-name/feature-or-fix`. * *Example:* `jane-doe/add-project-kickoff-template` 

2. **Make Your Changes:** * Add or edit the documentation, templates, or playbooks as needed on your new branch.

 3. **Open a Pull Request:** * When your changes are ready, push your branch to the repository and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch. * Provide a clear title for your PR (e.g., "Feat: Add Project Kickoff Template"). * In the description, explain **what** you changed and **why**.
